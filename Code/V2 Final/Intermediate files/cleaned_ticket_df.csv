gentles,

i have two devices that are trying to share an ip address. they are trying to share 96.26.27.9619. one is a printer with the hostname of prtjc0074, and the other is a new display for erp. the display is using dhcp to get its address assigned and the printer is hard coded.

my guess is that the address 96.26.27.9619 did not get set to a static address in dhcp. i need this corrected so the display will pick up another address.

access to bex,"

received from: yfqoaepn.xnezhsit@gmail.com

hello,

till last week i was accessing bex reports using mms portal and there were no issues.

starting this week the system is incredibly slow when i log in and finally does not allow me to access any reports.

can it be the issue with any maintenance or my access rights or rather i should try to access bex using different way?

below the print screen from what i see after log in:
[cid:image001.png@01d2310c.f184b360]

i am also able to get to finance reports (see below), however when i click ""profitability analysis"" (as i was always doing) separate window is open however apart rom that the screen is blank.

erp pi and msd crm connectivity issue- serirtce certificate renewal,"hi all

we have a connectivity issue between erp pi and msd crm due to certificate renewal on azure websites and that certificate is not yet updated on erp pi side.

issue: changes to data records (accounts, sales area data, partner functions, contacts, leads) are not being processed from erp pi to 
worked with IT


msd crm and vice versa in all environments (prod, qa and dev).
issue start time: 24th oct ~8:15pm

troubleshooting steps: 
1. when tryhdty from customer master team reported the issue that a prospect account created in erp didn't come into msd yet â€“ erp pi team observed that the records are in ""still awaiting acknowledgement"" status â€“ which basically means they are not yet delivered/received by the target system.
2. upon some log analysis and trying to identify the root cause between erp pi, basis and msd teams â€“ it's been observed that the issue has started in production environment since around 8:15pm est on 24th oct.
3. we observed the same behavior with azure mfg_tool and erp pi logs of other non-production environments as well.
4. you can find error screenshots from erp pi system in the mail chain.

root cause: it appears that the certificate for azure webapps have been updated on 29th sept 2016 as it is nearing the expiration date (11th jan 2017). but the new certificate is not updated on erp pi (they are not even aware of this change!). so, when the production azure webapp (company-crm-sp-mfg_toolt.azurewebsites.net) got restarted on 24th oct around 8:15pm â€“ this connectivity appears to have been broken.

next steps: 
1. we need the azure webapp certificate chain to be sent to erp basis team so that they can update it on erp pi system. whom can i reach out to for receiving the certificate details? do we have an azure admin in house or do you want me to open a case with microsoft?
2. once certificate is received, maybe we can first do this on qa system and then upon confirmation that it works, we can apply it to production and other environments.

pricing condition issue in oa,"

received from: rayhtukumujar.br2@company.com

hello,

in the recent past, we are facing an issue of pricing condition not getting changed while booking the order.

though we override the pricing condition with znr, the pricing condition remains as zlp1 only.

for example, in oa 36131265, the price was over written with znr condition with a nett price of rs. 5726.54.  but still pricing condition is shown as zlp1 with standard discount.

what we have observed is whenever there are sub delivery items created due to non-availability of stock, this issue crops up.  that too, after the challan is created, it becomes too difficult to make any changes.

we request you to look into this immediately, assign sev2 ticket and resolve the same.

await your feedback.

so, the issue is that for some reason it is defaulting to a usa printer for the delivery note.   what is your printer number and i will send it to the printer?  for future orders, before you save the delivery, go to extraïƒ delivery outputïƒ  header and change the printer in communication method.

good morning,

i just sent a request but found more data. so i received the attached email asking to look into the issue. when i look at the inwarehouse_tool (0159274337) referenced in the email, i saw the sample line was charged at cost when it shouldn't have been. when i go into the order, step on the sample line, go to document flow, i see a completely different inwarehouse_tool number than what is referenced. the inwarehouse_tool highlight below is for no cost, as it should be.

when i look at the document flow for the entire order, i see both inwarehouse_tools.

please help me understand why the customer was inwarehouse_toold twice for the sample, and why the second inwarehouse_tool is at cost when it should not be. let me know what i need to do on my end to help with this, please.

this role has been requested and i have approved it numerous times in the past.
the role is approved.

this will still not resolve the issue at hand. that issue will deal with the users attributes and possibly with hr org data.
please loop in the erp:purchasing team and the global hr data team to get this completed.

dear all

this is jay from plant_69.
plant_69 receives airwaybill label from erp whenever we do pgi for export. sometimes, zebra printer doesn't print the label so
plant_69 cancel the shipment and re-do pgi.

is there another way for us to have the label not to cancel pgi and re-do pgi ?

this all started with this email; ""i called company and spoke with wkpnlvts oumeaxcz and has confirmed that the items are in route from germany and are scheduled to get to them on 10/18/16 and turn around and ship to us.  the new delivery date is for 10/19/16.  she was not sure why the date of 12/16/16 is on the company center.""

after investigating this and looking at screen shots provided by heidi, this is what is happening.  ""manufacturing updated the information in the system, and if a csr ran an apo availability check on the art, they could see the updated date of 10/19, but it did not update the delivery date in the order.  i went into the order and manually ran a apo stock update on the order, and it updated the delivery date to 10/19.  if the customer were to look at it now through company center, they would see a delivery date of 10/19.""

when manufacturing updates the delivery time for an order, it has to update on all open orders for that item.  in this case it did not.  we are loosing orders because of this issue as it has been going on for some time now, but this is the first time i have documented screen shots of what was going on.  csrs can not run apo every time a date is changed in erp.  this has to be automated.  anything less is unacceptable.

hello,

during the ongoing   internal audit  conducted by e&y  , it was  observed that in list of   inwarehouse_tools attached , tax rate  was different from the one  updated  in the product hierarchy

request you to look into the reason  for few samples  and identify reasons   why incorrect  tax rate was captured  in inwarehouse_tool tax  and not as per product hierarchy .

also let us know whether   it   was system error .

problems with wifi,"

received from: hpeknoam.yrfowmva@gmail.com

good morning,

i use my dell latitude 7350 in my home office using my own wifi network for internet access.
often when i wake it up from powersave mode it is still connected to my local wifi network, but as a â€žnot identified"" network with no internet connection. my private owned devices (pc, smartphone,tablet) still work fine.
i have to shut down and restart the dell again to get a proper connection.

please advise what to do, as restarting the dell a couple of times over the day is annoying and time kirtyling.

partial confirmation info sent to erp but machine status behaving differently (usa),"usa go-live week. issue reported on 9/21

order #226038501 
op # 0030 
work center # 73122161

operation was in prir status [9/2sartlgeo lhqksbdx2.33 pm] but mii won't allow to resume run. 
gergryth changed status in mii from prst to prir, it changed status in to-di list but not in machine summary

start process = 9/20 19.43 = 7.43 pm
current time = 9/2sartlgeo lhqksbdx2.50 pm
time elapsed ~17 hours and that's what we're seeing on machine summary dashbankrd meaning mii did send partial confirmation information to erp but didn't used the same information for machine status view etc. 

so, in summary, the partial confirmation information made it to erp perfectly fine but the machine status windows wasn't updated with partial confirmation pause and behaved as if partial confirmation pause never happened





example from usa
for usa location and order 226033677, operation 10

mii showed the order in prpf status, looking at erp, order was partially confirmed followed by ""automatic pause"" which mii adds. change log shows all entries were done by miiadmin. it's weird since erp is showing expected status which is provided by mii but mii itself is showing prpf status which does not make sense. reporting this issue so team can do a deep dive and come up with the solution

more info for email admins

status code: 550 5.7.23

this error occurs when sender policy framdntyework (spf) validation for the sender's domain fails. if you're the sender's email admin, make sure the spf records for your domain at your domain registrar are set up correctly. office 365 supports only one spf record (a txt record that defines spf) for your domain. include the following domain name: spf.protection.outlook.com. if you have a hybrid configuration (some mailboxes in the cloud, and some mailboxes on premises) or if you're an exchange online protection standalone customer, add the outbound ip address of your on-premises servers to the txt record.

for more information and instructions about configuring spf records see customize an spf record to validate outbound mail sent from your domain<#bkmk_spfrecords>.

hello,

the issue is that your userid is locked in erp SID_34 and in erp SID_39.
you need to go to the password_management_tool password manager and first select the option ""unlock accounts"", after that select the option ""change password""
once that is completed successfully, you should logon to distributor_tool with that new password.

re: need a little help--please,"

received from: bcefayom.lzhwcgvb@gmail.com

shathyra, lunjuws

zd13 is the delivery output type which was developed for baker huges when usa went live on erp..

delivery note output type ""zdus"" will be added automatically as soon as the delivery note is created if there is no specific customer specific output type maintained.

in this scenario since we have already a customer specific output ""zd13"" maintained in output config, ""zdus"" will be automatically replaced with ""zd13"" & it will print immediately in ""hx08""printer. (printer hx08 has been defined as default printer for sales org 1101 and customer 81917193 combination).
[cid:image003.png@01SID_353fb.6857f6c0]

the complexity is that we are shipping to customer ""81917193"" from both usa and usa.

can you please confirm if we are using z_chk to print the delivery note usa.

lunjuws: we need your help to check with usa team if they are using z_chk for printing delivery note..

based on the above information we shall check on the possibilities and let you know..

subject: need a little help--please

sorry, i never email you to just say hey-how's it going...but you know how it's going-i'm sure.....   :)

my dilemma is-since we have started shipping to bakyhrer huhuyghes-our delivery notes are still printing to usa.  who do i need to contact about this?  if it is the help desk-i'm not sure what/how to ask for it.  they aren't as easy to explain stuff to as you are...  we are wanting the transaction ""zdus"" to be added to  the delivery output screen, instead of zd13.    usa used zd13   we were using zd12   but zdus is what we really need to be using.
  if i have talked myself in circles   let me know and i'll try to explain it a little better.

this is an example of  what we want
[cid:image001.png@01SID_353fa.f482f2e0]

this is what we get right now  after we go in and add the zd12 to get a delivery note to print here---

batch number is not appearing in pdf output of engineering_tool,"

received from: xqkydoat.bveiyclr@gmail.com

dear sir,
refer below snapshot of pdf output of engineering_tool.
batch number is not appearing in pdf output.
[cid:image008.jpg@01SID_35366.4a922790]

why batch number is important?
in case of variation in tool life from batch to batch, customer raises the complaint. we send ccif with engineering_tool. in engineering_tool software we enter batch number but when i download pdf, it doesn't show batch number. without batch number, analysis cannot be done. that's why it's very important to capture batch number in engineering_tool pdf output.

for your necessary action.

hi it,

i regularly have trouble with erp lagging, particularly it seems after 12pm our time.
last week, especially friday it was very bad all day.
yesterday and today, again it seems to lag after that 12 noon time.
this is becoming continuously embarrassing during phone calls when i am required to search for stock or quote/order over the phone as i have to apologise for the system taking so long.

there are two other csr's in the building, uisewznr ewtmkphs rarely has the same trouble (his system seems faster though), much faster than mine or duoyrpvi wgjpviul, amy's system will lag but not as much as mine.

can you please shed some light on this scenario?

note:  it is more convenient for this office if i can be contacted mid/late mornings.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.16.4.16/isensor04.company.com device generating '52151 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookie set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.22.28.222 to port 55372/tcp of your android-13849fa3e9c2e1e3/12.90.42.78296 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that android-13849fa3e9c2e1e3/12.90.42.78296 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
 soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

the ctoc has received at least 4 occurrences of '52853 vid68372 possible magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_gridgetcsvfile() sql injection attempt inbound (cve-2015-1397)' alerts from your isensor device (208.211.136.207/isensplant_247.company.com) for traffic (not blocked) sourcing from port 55334/tcp of 166.78.155.100 (dallas, usa) destined to port 80/tcp of 208.211.136.158 (usa, usa) that occurred on 2016-09-17 at 11:35:02. this indicates that the external host at 166.78.155.100 and possibly other sources are attempting to discover if your public facing servers including 208.211.136.158 is vulnerable to the ""magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() sql injection vulnerability"" described in cve-2015-1397.

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the ctoc, or by calling us at  we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted.
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets). 
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address. 

we would not recommend options 2 and 3 since the exploit code is in the wild and merely identifying the sources of the attack may not be very useful, and we can always run reports on the portal to identify a list of attackers. instead we would recommend auditing your environment for vulnerable systems and updating them as necessary. once you have completed this, you could go with option 1 to suppress alerting on these events.

sincerely,
 ctoc

technical details
=========================
a vulnerability exists in magento due to insufficient input validation within the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function. a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct sql injection attacks on vulnerable systems.
magento is an eusa platform. a vulnerability exists in magento commstorage_product edition (ce) versions 1.4.00 through 1.5.0.1, version 1.5.1.0, versions 1.6.0.x, versions 1.6.1.x through 1.6.2.x, versions 1.7.x, and versions 1.8.x and 1.9.x and in magento enterprise edition (ee) versions prior to 1.14.2.0 due to insufficient input validation. user-controllable supplied via the 'popularity[field_expr]' paramdntyeter, when the 'popularity[from]' or 'popularity[to]' paramdntyeter is set, is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious content by the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function prior to being stored in a $fieldname variable and used in an sql query. remote administrators could leverage this issue to conduct sql injection attacks by injectncqulao qauighdplicious sql code into an affected input. successful exploitation may permit an attacker to manipulate sql queries and execute arbitrary sql commands on the underlying database.

the ctoc has received at least 4 occurrences of '52853 vid68372 possible magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_gridgetcsvfile() sql injection attempt inbound (cve-2015-1397)' alerts from your isensor device (208.211.136.207/isensplant_247.company.com) for traffic (not blocked) sourcing from port 55334/tcp of 166.78.155.100 (dallas, usa) destined to port 80/tcp of 208.211.136.158 (usa, usa) that occurred on 2016-09-17 at 11:35:02. this indicates that the external host at 166.78.155.100 and possibly other sources are attempting to discover if your public facing servers including 208.211.136.158 is vulnerable to the ""magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() sql injection vulnerability"" described in cve-2015-1397.

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the ctoc, or by calling us at. we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted.
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets). 
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address. 

we would not recommend options 2 and 3 since the exploit code is in the wild and merely identifying the sources of the attack may not be very useful, and we can always run reports on the portal to identify a list of attackers. instead we would recommend auditing your environment for vulnerable systems and updating them as necessary. once you have completed this, you could go with option 1 to suppress alerting on these events.

sincerely,
 ctoc


=========================
technical details
=========================
a vulnerability exists in magento due to insufficient input validation within the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function. a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct sql injection attacks on vulnerable systems.
magento is an eusa platform. a vulnerability exists in magento commstorage_product edition (ce) versions 1.4.00 through 1.5.0.1, version 1.5.1.0, versions 1.6.0.x, versions 1.6.1.x through 1.6.2.x, versions 1.7.x, and versions 1.8.x and 1.9.x and in magento enterprise edition (ee) versions prior to 1.14.2.0 due to insufficient input validation. user-controllable supplied via the 'popularity[field_expr]' paramdntyeter, when the 'popularity[from]' or 'popularity[to]' paramdntyeter is set, is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious content by the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function prior to being stored in a $fieldname variable and used in an sql query. remote administrators could leverage this issue to conduct sql injection attacks by injectncqulao qauighdplicious sql code into an affected input. successful exploitation may permit an attacker to manipulate sql queries and execute arbitrary sql commands on the underlying database.

design_tool service: file naming convention has changed,"the geengineering_tooloductdata web service calls the design_tool service to obtain cad models for engineering_tool.
i believe this link points to the design_tool uacyltoe hxgaycze service: 

looks like the naming convention has changed in the last few days and files returned by this service are being named with just the materials_management number.
(e.g. mm 7304975 in SID_34. see the attached fw  engineering_tool drills.msg for more details)

the change is causing issues with models not being returned to  engineering_tool.
engineering_tool will be demoed at imts starting on monday the 12th. 
need an urgent fix to revert any changes that might have been made to the file naming convention for files from the design_tool service.

below are the original rules uli had implemented for file names for cad files returned by this service.
here are the implemented naming rules:

â€¢ if there is a cad_catalog_iso it's taken, 
o else if there is a cad_catalog_ansi it's taken,
ï‚§ else rqfhiong zkwfqagb is taken
â€¢ an underscore plus cad_graph_type is added 
â€¢ finally the original file extension is added

approval workflow problems,"
i am approfghaching you, as we have problems with our approval workflow for credit memo requests respectively rmas.
i opened several tickets regarding this topic, which unfortunately did not lead to a final solution.
maybe it is a (erp-) language problem for my part.
anyway, i  hope, that you can help to get this fixed.

the approval levels for our organization are as follows (regardless who is the sales person in customer account)
level 1 (1.000â‚¬-4.999â‚¬): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as subsitute, if possible)
level 2 (5.000â‚¬-9.999â‚¬): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as substitute if possible)
level 3 (10.000â‚¬-24.999â‚¬): qsoxltny dzjespml (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)
level 4 (25.000â‚¬ plus): michghytuael rÃ¼nz (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)

it often happens, that these workflows are routed to the wrong person.
lauacyltoe hxgaycze example: rma 7611183856 was routed to me at level 1 and approved, but then to jmkcewds qkoipbzn at level 2, wo has nothing to do with it.

it takes a lot of time, to gather the wrong routed workflows and to forward them to the responsible person.

i appreciate your help.

bahdqrcs xvgzdtqj's onbankrding experience,"

received from: xzupryaf.vlbikhsm@gmail.com

hello,

bahdqrcs xvgzdtqj was an intern that we hired on full-time effective aug. 16th. we followed the process of having her old manager transfer her to her new manager in oneteam and then her new manager entered her new job and compensation information like he's been instructed to. however, i have to be honest, her onbankrding experience has been a disaster so far. she says that every time she calls hrss to help her out, they are not very helpful or resolve her issues. hrss will tell her it's an ""it problem"" and it will tell her that it's an ""hr problem."" here are some of the issues that she's still having:


1.      no access to benefit information on collaboration_tool â€“ when she follows the directions that she was given, she gets an error message that says ""needs approval, request has been submitted.""

2.      no ethics access

3.      no expense report access â€“ she was able to enter her expense report, however when she went to submit it she got an error message and now when she tries to log-in, she gets an error message. it said that this is an it problem.

4.      no access to the vpn â€“ again, it said that hr needs to update the SID_34? i'm not really sure what that is.

5.      incorrect paychecks â€“ she did not receive a paycheck on 8/30. i told her that depending when her information was processed, payroll might not have caught the fact that she's salary now and then it should all be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck. sharee emailed her yesterday and made it sound like everything was going to be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck, but then sent a follow-up email saying that because u2 already ran, she was not going to be able to backdate and the effective date for this change was going to have to be 9/1. she wants liuytre to provide her hours worked from 8/18 â€“ 8/31. this is not going to work because liuytre stopped tracking her hours since she is now a salaried employee. she was also at a company conference the week of 8/22 and ""technically"" worked way more than 40 hours that week because she was part of meetings, dinners and after hours' team building activities.

can someone from it and shared services be her ""designated"" contact and work with her through these issues until everything is figured out? if something is an it issue, can hrss follow-up with it so she's not being passed back and forth? she is beyond frustrated and only has until next friday to figure out her benefits before her eligibility timeframdntye is up.

printer cl98,"

received from: azxhejvq.fyemlavd@gmail.com

good morning

i have made several attempts to print to printer cl98.  i have also powered the device down then back up. and retried printing.  no print but the printer drivers are refreshed.
had a colleague try and she had the same results

i deleted the printer cl98 from my pc and reinstalled it.  it reinstalled as prtgn0022.  when i printed to it the print came out successfully.

how can a printer be changed from cl98 to gn22 without notification?  should this printer be known as gn22 or is this a error that requires further investigation?

drucker ag71 in fÃ¼rth,"

received from: osjqfbvw.hlmgrfpx@gmail.com

hallo,

unser netzwerkdrucker ag71 hÃ¶rt nicht mehr auf zu drucken.
ein â€žgast"" scheint versehentlich immer neue druckauftrÃ¤ge zu generieren bzw. laut service techniker vom hersteller hp ist wohl ein spool auftrag im netz gespeichert â€“ wir kÃ¶nnen die druckauftrÃ¤ge nicht sehen, nachverfolgen oder stoppen.

alle versuche, die druckauftrÃ¤ge abzubrechen, sind fehlgeschlagen, auch ein ziehen des steckers oder des lan-kabels nÃ¼tzt nichts.

wer kann helfen?
laut hp sollte das der administrator kÃ¶nnen.

danke.

above is the link to the gtehdnyu belt tracker.  the person who generated this site (nicrhty pfgyhtu) and wrote the original programdnty had it set up so that the full time oe personnel did not ever receive recertification notices and warnings.  all of a sudden this week we are all receiving those emails.  i am attaching one of the emails.

hana ,"

received from: nealxjbc.owjduxai@gmail.com

earlier i started a chat with rakthyesh.  i was pulling a report though hana and after selecting the analysis tab and refreshing i was thing going to display.  i needed to filter this template to add my plant.  when i would select display all of my boxes were empty (see attached).  he did something and asked me to close and reopen.  once i reopened my analysis tab was gone so i wasn't able to refresh to then go to display to see if my filters were fixed.

he then fixed my analysis tab while we were still in chat but after doing this when i tried to select display the white boxes that i was seeing was no longer showing.  i would hit display and all i could see was my spreadsheet (no boxes).

he said he would have to do a ticket.  i've not been copied on a ticket buy i need to run this report.

before sending this email i went back into hana to see if by chance my report or problem was fixed and the analysis tab is gone again.

if you can please correct this for me.

tor activity does not immediately indicate malicious activity, however the presence of anonymizing software should be investigated to determine if this is authorized or expected activity. tor activity indicates a possible policy violation which in turn could lead to a potential compromise. tor is being increasingly used by malware, therefore tor activity may also indicate a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high severity/full escalation master ticket for all unblocked events related to this vulnerability (i.e. we are creating a singular ticket for all inbound threats related to this vulnerability). this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related events until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. 

it should be noted that blocking each source ip address may not necessarily be productive due to attackers' ability to switch ip addresses through the use of proxies, anonymizing software such as tor, and vpns. please investigate your environment to determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of the application being targeted and ensure that you are running the most recent non-vulnerable version of windows, and that your devices are patched and properly hardened against attacks.

if you would like these events handled differently, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:
1) autoresolve any events related to attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted or if you are running a non-vulnerable version of the application
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets)

re: deployment notification | telephony_software 2016,"

received from: wqfzjycu.omleknjd@gmail.com

hi deeghyupak,

i was on vacation when your e-mail was sent last week and only managed to see it on my return minutes before the automatically deployment.

on a general note unless there is a critical security risk deployment these updates should be limited to once a month, so far this month this is the third deployment. you may not realize the impact this has on our users especially the unannounced updates. in addition with users similarly to csr who are working directly with our customers, i do not think it is the best practice to deploy automatically updates especially to all users all at the same time.

the impact of yesterday's deployment was that our csr phones were not operating for over 2 hours during the morning.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 80.71.06.702/company-european-asa.company.com-1 device generating a high volume of 'repeat outbound connection for 135/tcp' alerts for traffic (blocked) from evhl8114123/10.16.140.231 to port 135/tcp (remote procedure call (rpc)) of external host 62.157.140.133. this may indicate a misconfiguration, where the firewall is blocking traffic to a legitimate server/application. this may also indicate a compromised host reaching out to a malicious host or propagating worm code.

1) full escalation for windows login failure alerts (explicit notification via a high priority ticket and a phone call)
2) automatically resolve windows login failure alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,

=========================
technical details
=========================
remote procedure call (rpc), also known as the loovexfbjy lmcaqfkz (loc-srv), is a microsoft windows protocol that allows an application to to execute code in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programdntymer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. that is, the programdntymer writes germanytially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing programdnty, or remote. 

an rpc is initiated by the client, which sends a request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied paramdntyeters. the remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. rpc runs on port 135, and is used in client/server applications (such as microsoft exchange clients, mgermanyger service, dhcp server, dns server, wins, as well as other windows applications). vulnerabilities in rpc have also been leveraged by several worms as a means for propagation. examples include:
-w32.blaster.worm/msblast/lovsan 
-w32.welchia/nachi
-w32.reatle

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 80.71.06.702/company-european-asa.company.com-1 device generating a high volume of 'repeat outbound connection for 135/tcp' alerts for traffic (blocked) from evhl8114123/10.16.140.231 to port 135/tcp (remote procedure call (rpc)) of external host 62.157.140.133. this may indicate a misconfiguration, where the firewall is blocking traffic to a legitimate server/application. this may also indicate a compromised host reaching out to a malicious host or propagating worm code.

we are escalating this incident to you via a medium priority ticket and email per our default event handling procedures. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 

1) full escalation for windows login failure alerts (explicit notification via a high priority ticket and a phone call)
2) automatically resolve windows login failure alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc

=========================
technical details
=========================
remote procedure call (rpc), also known as the loovexfbjy lmcaqfkz (loc-srv), is a microsoft windows protocol that allows an application to to execute code in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programdntymer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. that is, the programdntymer writes germanytially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing programdnty, or remote. 

an rpc is initiated by the client, which sends a request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied paramdntyeters. the remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. rpc runs on port 135, and is used in client/server applications (such as microsoft exchange clients, mgermanyger service, dhcp server, dns server, wins, as well as other windows applications). vulnerabilities in rpc have also been leveraged by several worms as a means for propagation. examples include:
-w32.blaster.worm/msblast/lovsan 
-w32.welchia/nachi
-w32.reatle

everything looked okay in the web app but users were not able to login.

i even tried to reset the password for one of the users but that didn't help either.

it is cumbersome to re-type the same info and create new accounts for each day.

it seems that there has been a lack of knowledge regarding this deployment of telephony_software in israel.

from the very beginning all our users apart from rabin have been working with the software in hebrew.

also i am not sure deployment on telephony_software pc's all at the same time should occur in the middle of the working day.

please let us know when you have a hebrew version available and then we can discuss the deployment.

hi daghyunny,

there was no issue with respect to new telephony_software application and it was deployed successfully through patching_antivirus_sw. deployment was scheduled based on the os language, which in this case was english.
since we were not supporting hebrew language in the past, we deployed english language telephony_software 2016 r2 in israel pcs.
csr team in israel had raised a concern that they can't work without hebrew language pack as confirmed by aofnvyzt eqiyskhm. same english package of new telephony_software application is deployed successfully for the aofnvyzt eqiyskhm and he is able to work without any issues. dyxrpmwo hcljzivn  local it from poland uninstalled new version of telephony_software and installed old telephony_software 4.0 on their pcs without informing us.

to fulfill local csr team requirement we can reschedule the new telephony_software application through remote deployment and hebrew language pack can be installed manually on their pcs.

zpdist_programdnty not allowing to distribute against planned orders and production orders,"
hello chandruhdty, ebi,

iÂ´ve created an example in SID_1 for debugging an fixing. production order to receive is 226138271 // mm# 4289785.
the issue does not only appear in case the user tries to ship against a planned order but also when trying to ship against a production order.

shipping against planned orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against planned orders in case the planned order finish date is due or past due (purple example in the screenshot). in case the planned order finish date is not due (red example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the planned order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against planned orders even though the planned order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the planned order start date rather than the planned order finish date to determine whether the planned order is due

shipping against production orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against production orders in case the basic finish date of the production order is due or past due (blue example). in case the basic finish date of the production order is not due (yellow example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the production order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against production orders even though the production order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the basic start date (which is already shown in the transaction) rather than the basic finish date to determine whether the production order is due",cfajzero vlygoksi,GRP_18,en,zpdist programdnty allowing distribute planned order production chandruhdty ebi i´ve created example debugging fixing order recei mm issue appear case user try sp also trying spping look like allow finish date due past purple screenshot red following tngs need changed force spment even though stock transfer use start rather determine whether duespping basic blue yellow wch already shown transaction,401,59,5.813559322033898,58,zpdist programdnty allowing distribute planned order production chandruhdty ebi i ve created example debugging fixing order recei mm issue appear case user try sp also trying spping look like allow finish date due past purple screenshot red following tngs need changed force spment even though stock transfer use start rather determine whether duespping basic blue yellow wch already shown transaction

new prospect accounts created in crm do not get an erp number ,"hello, 

i have two specific cases where a newly created prospect account in crm (modern construction and sandfield engineering) does not get an erp number, even after some days. after having run an advanced find search i found we have 385 such cases. please see attached file that describes the issue and the unique steps. 

if prospects do not get an erp id it results in the fact that they do not show up in the usersÂ´""my active prospects"" view because it filters on prospects with erp id. users think that the account was not created and create the over and over again. we should review if we want to change the logic behind this view - i assume the filter was put in to exlude non-complete accounts. 

another issue i found during this troubleshooting process is i deactivated such a duplicate prospect and the audit log shows that 5 minutes later the account got activated again and got the erp number, too. please investigate this one too.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

hello amerirtcas pc support,

we have detected at least 226 occurrences of your firewall att-singapore-asa.company.com-1/54.96.80.216 dropping traffic sourcing from HostName_17-new/29.26.13.3095 and destined to port 135 of one or more destination devices. this activity may indicate one of the following:
1. an infection on this host
2. a misconfigured firewall
3. a misconfigured host
4. port scan (authorized or unauthorized)

we have created a ticketing_tool ticket and assigned it to amerirtcas pc services. inc1530161

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
â€¢ software\kasperskylab
â€¢ software\eset
â€¢ software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
â€¢ software\kasperskylab
â€¢ software\eset
â€¢ software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

hi,

i'm writing on behalf of jdlxkygf wlzqaivr and mikhghytr ramdntysey. 

1.       jdlxkygf wlzqaivr: davidthd's former manager (and expense report approver), gergrythg bigleman, is no longer with the company. davidthd has an expense report in gergrythg's queue. 
2.       how does mikhghytr ramdntysey get access to that to approve and/or forward to the correct manager? 
3.       how can we ensure there are no other requests in gergrythg's universal worklist? 

note: our office will be closed, monday, september 5, 2016 for the labor day holiday.
